# hw04-stylization

## Project Overview:
In this assignment, you will use a 2D concept art piece as inspiration to create a stylized 3D scene in Unity. This will give you the opportunity to explore transforming concepts into graphics rendered in realtime, as well as explore rendering in Unity.

## Picking a piece of concept art
Choose a simple illustration to guide your stylization. Choose a relatively simple piece of art THAT INCLUDES OUTLINES. Here are some examples of styles that will work well. Feel ffree to choose one of these, but we encourage your to pick your own.
[EXAMPLE IMAGES]


## More Interesting Surface and Shadow Shader
Based on your concept art, let's create a custom surface shader for the objects in your scene. This should include the following:

Surface shading:
  * Surface shading that conveys the effects of different amount of light on the surface of the objects. This should be more complex than our three tone lab toon shader.
  * A SPECIAL second shader that adds a glow, a highlight or some other special effect that

Shadows:
* Interesting rendering of shadows. This could be a texture, simplified or warped shapes.

## Depth and Normal Based Outlines
1. Create render features for sourcing custom depth and normal maps of select objects in your scene
2. Create an interesting, animated outline effect that resembles some kind of 2D art medium.
  1. E.g. Pencil Sketch/Crayons/Paint Strokes/Etc.
  2. In addition to depth/normal based post processing, you are also allowed to explore non-post process techniques such as inverse hull edge rendering for outer edges. 

## Full Screen Post Process Effect
1. Using what you know about render features, create your own render feature for some kind of interesting full screen post process effect
    1. E.g. An animated watercolor vignette


## Interactivity


Other aspects of the HW:
Picking inspiration art
Keep it simple!
Outlines
Aesthetic colors
Patterns	
Sketchy? Hatching? Crayon? Watercolor?
Geometry
Sketchfab, etc.
Mixamo for animated
Manual creation
Maya, ZBrush
Do this at your own benefit and peril. Your geometry/modeling will NOT be graded in this assignment. 
Interactivity
Unity is a game engine after all
Make an interactive component of your scene
E.g. Pressing a button results in all of the materials switching/going crazy- something simple like that!
Think of the post process water effect in Minecraft- it can be simple like that.
Final product:
A turnaround mp4 of your rendered scene!
